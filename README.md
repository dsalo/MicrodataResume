# MicrodataResume
Basic HTML resume with schema.org microdata.

This is meant as an example for LIS 640 "Linked Data." The file passes HTML validation at validator.w3.org, and works more or less as I intended in OpenLink's Structured Data Sniffer.

For the record: microdata is pretty awful to implement for resumes.

If you catch something I did horribly wrong, don't hesitate to let me know.
